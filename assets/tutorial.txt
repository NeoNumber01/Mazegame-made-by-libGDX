You wake up from a nightmare, 
only to find yourself in an even deeper dream,
an unknown space, dim lighting, and a labyrinth 
full of twists and turns, with the occasional sound of monsters 
echoing in the distance. Could this be an even stranger dream? 
However, everything around you feels so real that it is 
hard to distinguish reality from illusion. 
No matter what, you must find the key inside the labyrinth, 
locate the path to the exit, and escape as soon as possible.

Beware of the monsters! 
When they try to give you a hug, 
don’t be fooled by their harmless appearance. 
They approach you to drain your life force.
